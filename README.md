# Hi :wave:, I'm Arlo

Hey, my names Arlo, and I'm a software and game developer seeking out new challenges to push myself.
Although I'm currently not working at a proffesional standard, that doesn't stop me from completing projects to perfection.

## Projects

Now although you may notice a lack of my repositorys that does not mean I cannot program.
In truth, I have only recently started using Github, and although I have worked on many projects
most of them have been lost. But who knows, when your reading this I may have may repositorys to my name,
but for now, lets have a quick look at my current ones.

### [4State](https://github.com/ArloM-dev/4state) - Current project

4State is a board game based on a game I bought while in France.
Its almost like a complicated version of tic tac toe, with a 4 by 4 grid
and pieces that have multiple qualitys or 'states' as I have called them.
Although it is not currently finished it should be available soon,
and I update the unity project files as I go along.

### [Tic tac toe](https://github.com/ArloM-dev/tic-tac-toe)

This is just an old project I found from when I had starting out programming,
and thought it would be nice to publish to github for people too mess around with.
Its quite basic and just functions as tic tac toe, but you do get to build custom programms.
The way it works is that when you play, the game uses the bots file to determine the next move.
This means you can either play other people, or build a program/bot to play against you.
