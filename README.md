# Hi :wave:, I'm Arlo

Hey, my name is Arlo, and I'm a software and game developer seeking out new challenges to push myself.
Although I'm currently not working at a professional standard, that doesn't stop me from completing projects to perfection.

### Hobbies

As someone who tends to get distracted easily, I tend to end up with a range of skills and hobbies.

Off the top of my head, the list includes:
- Programming
- Chess
- Cubing
- Maths (For fun, I know)
- 3D Modelling (Blender)
- Cycling
- Reading
- Going to the gym
- Magic  <br/>

Some of these I haven't done for a while, but I still tend to revisit them every once in a while.

## Projects

Now, although you may notice a lack of my repositories, that does not mean I cannot program.
In truth, I have only recently started using GitHub, and although I have worked on many projects, most of them have been lost.
But who knows, when you're reading this I may have many repositories to my name, but for now, let's have a quick look at my current ones.


### [4State](https://github.com/ArloM-dev/4state) - Current project

4State is a board game based on a game I bought while in France. 
It's almost like a complicated version of tic-tac-toe, with a 4 by 4 grid and pieces that have multiple qualities or 'states' as I have called them. 
Although it is not currently finished, it should be available soon, and I update the Unity project files as I go along.

### [Tic tac toe](https://github.com/ArloM-dev/tic-tac-toe)

This is just an old project I found from when I had started out programming, and thought it would be nice to publish to GitHub for people to mess around with. 
It's quite basic and just functions as tic-tac-toe, but you do get to build custom programs. 
The way it works is that when you play, the game uses the bot's file to determine the next move. 
This means you can either play other people or build a program/bot to play against you.
